# ICON - Hyperconnect the World

ICON is a scalable smart contract enabled blockchain platform with an innovative consensus mechanism, decentralized governance structure, and a long-term goal of interoperability between enterprise and public blockchains.

As a brief overview of the technical details: ICON has smart contracts known as SCOREs that are written in Python, an enhanced BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) based algorithm known as LFT, and a concept known as “Virtual Step” allowing SCORE operators to cover user transaction fees.

Our goal is to Hyperconnect the World, and by combining groundbreaking technology, a strong community, and relentless growth strategies we believe this goal is reachable.

# Client SDK
Client SDK implements ICON JSON-RPC API v3. Java, Python, and JavaScript libraries are available for your application to interact with Smart Contracts and the ICON network. SDKs and T-Bears CLI provide an ability to generate a signed transaction using given private key. If you use raw JSON-RPC APIs, you need to generate a signature for each transaction, please refer to [Generating transaction signature](https://icon-project.github.io/docs/transaction_signature.html) to learn how to sign a transaction.
